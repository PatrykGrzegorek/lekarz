## Tips for devs

### Dumping pip installations into the file
If you installed new pip dependency you need to allow others to know about it. To do so it is best to save all requirements
in one file, which in this case in named `requirements.txt`. You can do this by typing following command: 

`pip freeze > requirements.txt`
